## Overview

**Checklist Management System** is a web-based application developed as part of my Integrated M.Sc. in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The system was designed and implemented for **TH&Co**, a chartered accountant firm based in Calicut, Kerala, to streamline task management, automate procedural checklists, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

The project focuses on three key user roles:
- **Admin**: Manages users and system operations.
- **Users**: Initiates tasks by submitting forms and selecting relevant checklists.
- **Checkers**: Verifies the accuracy of submitted forms against checklist criteria.

This application leverages the Django framework with SQLite for data management, providing a scalable, secure, and efficient task management solution.

## Features

### Admin Module
- User account management (creation, update, and deletion)
- Checklist creation and management
- Performance tracking and analytics dashboard
- Role-based access control

### User Module
- Procedure initiation with form submissions
- Track status of submitted procedures
- Receive feedback from Checkers and make corrections as needed

### Checker Module
- Review submitted procedures against checklist criteria
- Return procedures for revisions or approve them for completion
- Access procedure history for auditing purposes

### Security & Data Management
- Role-based access control for secure user management
- Data encryption and secure storage to protect sensitive information
- Audit trails for all major operations

## Technology Stack
